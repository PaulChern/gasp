The initial version of this code was developed in the group of Gerbrand Ceder
at MIT in the summer of 2007.  Much thanks to Chris Fischer, Shyue Ping Ong,
Geoffroy Hauter, and Anubhav Jain from the Ceder group.

Since 2008, it has been developed in the group of Richard Hennig at Cornell and
the University of Florida -- contributors include Will Tipton, Ben Revard,
